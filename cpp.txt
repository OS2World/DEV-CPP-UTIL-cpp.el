Parse a text for C preprocessor conditionals, and highlight or hide
the text inside the conditionals as you command.  

Other features: 

- Optionally hide the cpp preprocessor statements. 
  This is useful when you have highlighted the text.

- Mark one branch of a conditional as read only, if desired.
  I.e. "Don't touch the OS/2 code."

- Cool mode for specifying how to display the conditionals. 
  Install the code just to see this, even if you don't care about cpp!

Think of it as the 90'ties version of `hideif.el'.  The main
difference is that cpp.el uses BRIGHT SPARKLING COLORS (when
available) and will gladly show both part of a conditional in
different colors.  On the other hand `hideif.el' will parse `#if'
expressions which is less useful with `cpp.el'.

Requires GNU Emacs 19 from FSF.  Works best with a color monitor.
Degenerates into `hideif.el' when used on a TTY, except that it
doesn't suddenly learn how to parse `#if' expressions.

I fixed the last bug (ha ha) about an hour ago, so this is very much
alpha quality code.
